"raine" and "chilbolton" directories contains all the scripts and files that were used to do the following:
--convert the vol files to cfradial netcdfs
--process the netcdfs to calculate biases for ZDR and Z for individual days
--notebooks to plot the output and determine biases for the whole project
--apply the calibration offsets to the data

"docs" contains the pdfs to describe the methodology used for the processing: conversion, calculating calibration values and applying calibration values. The calibration methodology itself is described in separate documents.
